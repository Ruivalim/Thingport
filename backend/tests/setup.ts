// port it got. On macOS a wildcard bind succeeds even when another program already holds that port
// on 127.0.0.1 alone (VS Code helpers and limactl do), and that program takes the connection: the
// test then gets someone else's reply -- "Parse Error: Expected HTTP/", or a body without the field
// it expects -- in whichever test happens to draw the port.
//
// Binding to 127.0.0.1 itself means the port it's given is free there. That bind is asynchronous,
// though, and supertest reads the port the moment the request is built, so the bind waits until
// the request is sent and the port is filled into its URL then.
